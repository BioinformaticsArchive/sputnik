# Adapted code for comparison with JPPF

This project is just a copy of the [feature selection application](../../../example-applications/feature-selection)
that has been changed to use [JPPF](http://www.jppf.org) for parallelization.

**In case you are interested in the feature selection algorithm, you should have a look at the [original project](../../../example-applications/feature-selection).**
